          <h2>About Nehru</h2>
          <p>
            Jawaharlal Nehru, (born Nov. 14, 1889, Allahabad, India—died May 27,
            1964, New Delhi), First prime minister of independent India
            (1947–64). Son of the independence advocate Motilal Nehru
            (1861–1931), Nehru was educated at home and in Britain and became a
            lawyer in 1912. More interested in politics than law, he was
            impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi’s approach to Indian independence.
            His close association with the Indian National Congress began in
            1919; in 1929 he became its president, presiding over the historic
            Lahore session that proclaimed complete independence (rather than
            dominion status) as India’s political goal. He was imprisoned nine
            times between 1921 and 1945 for his political activity. When India
            was granted limited self-government in 1935, the Congress Party
            under Nehru refused to form coalition governments with the Muslim
            League in some provinces; the hardening of relations between Hindus
            and Muslims that followed ultimately led to the partition of India
            and the creation of Pakistan. Shortly before Gandhi’s assassination
            in 1948, Nehru became the first prime minister of independent India.
            He attempted a foreign policy of nonalignment during the Cold War,
            drawing harsh criticism if he appeared to favour either camp. During
            his tenure, India clashed with Pakistan over the Kashmir region and
            with China over the Brahmaputra River valley. He wrested Goa from
            the Portuguese. Domestically, he promoted democracy, socialism,
            secularism, and unity, adapting modern values to Indian conditions.
            His daughter, Indira Gandhi, became prime minister two years after
            his death.
